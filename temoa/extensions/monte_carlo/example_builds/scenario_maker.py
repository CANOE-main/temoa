This file is intended to be a simple EXAMPLE for testing mainly of how one might make a set of
runs for a Monte Carlo simulation.

This scenario is based on Utopia with the following random variables:

Cost of Imported Oil will have a normal distribution of *relative changes* applied in all periods
Residential Heating (RH) will have a similar distribution, with some negative correlation (seems logical that
there is some hidden price sensitivity, even though RH could be satisfied from electricity as well.)

Additionally, we will assume there is an independent 20% chance that the govt will subsidize new nuclear
power by:
  (a) subsidizing the cost of any Investment Cost by 40%, in the out-years of 2000, 2010 (but not 1990)
  (b) paying all fixed costs in the same years.

Let's make a set of 500 runs and explore output
