# Requirements for core model functionality
# python=3.7.3
# tested using python 3.7.9.
# There was some compatibility issue (see dev notes) about the introduction of keyword "asynch" about
# this time and using 3.7.9 and pyomo 3.5.1 fixed it.  So if using this file to set up, fetch 3.7.9 from
# python.org and use pip to install these requirements.  Other deltas are noted below.

# to use pip to install (in a venv, if desired):
# $: pip install -r requirements.txt
