The outputs csv file in this folder is a capture of myopic run on Utopia dataset for 2 time periods.

myopic runs don't (easily) produce an objective value that can be accessed and it seems that the emissions
values should be an OK proxy for that.  This particular commodity has emissions values in all the years of interest
across the myopic periods and should serve as an OK functional check.

To be done:  After re-working the temoa_myopic runs, use this as a basis of comparison
